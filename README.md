# React-to-do-list-
A React-based To-Do List allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks. Users input tasks via a text field, and tasks are displayed with checkboxes for completion and delete buttons. React's state management enables real-time updates to the task list. The interface can be styled with CSS for visual appeal.

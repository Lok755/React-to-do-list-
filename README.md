# React-to-do-list-
A React-based To-Do List allows users to add, complete, and remove tasks. Users input tasks via a text field, and tasks are displayed with checkboxes for completion and delete buttons. React's state management enables real-time updates to the task list. The interface can be styled with CSS for visual appeal. 


##This React-based To-Do List app allows users to manage tasks effectively. The app utilizes React hooks (useState and useRef) to handle state and manage user input. Users can add new tasks, edit existing tasks, ##mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks.

#Key features of the app include:

Input field for adding new tasks.
Buttons for adding tasks (with icons for adding or updating) and deleting tasks.
Dynamic rendering of tasks in a list format.
Ability to edit tasks inline and update them.
The app uses FontAwesome icons for visual cues and Bootstrap for styling (though the Bootstrap import is currently commented out).

State management ensures that the task list is updated in real-time as users interact with the app. The component-based architecture of React makes the app scalable and maintainable, allowing for easy addition of new features and enhancements. Overall, this To-Do List app provides a user-friendly interface for task management.
